# TDMS_Converter

`TDMS_Converter` is a small tool to decode `tdms` files produced by LabVIEW

## Prerequisites

You need `npTDMS`, `matplotlib`, `pandas` and `numpy` Python libraries to run `TDMS_Converter`.

For example, on Ubuntu, this is the command line to install these libraries:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python python-pip python-matplotlib python-numpy python-pandas
pip install npTDMS
```

While the script is written in Python 3, it should be compatible with Python 2 (but it is unsupported and may become broken anytime).

## Equipment

To produce `tdms` files, you need LabVIEW
